# JavaScript-HTML-Front-End-Demos

I've included some basic front-end concepts I worked on through my coursework that demonstrates 
interlacing HTML with JavaScript to create some dynamic behaviors.

The First demo is a simple countdown timer built by using JS on an HTML platform.

The Second demo shows how to change an array of colored bars from 1 color to another by using a button click
function powered by use of JavaScripting.

The Third demo uses an HTML and JS combo to visually construct a simple calculator for the user to calculate simple
math between 2 designated numbers supplied by an individual user.

The Fourth demo also takes user input in order to create a countdown sequence designated from user input which will result 
in an event when the sequence concludes.
